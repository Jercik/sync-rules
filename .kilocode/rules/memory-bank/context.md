## Current Work Focus and Priorities

- Project is in pre-implementation planning stage.
- High-level implementation plan finalized, emphasizing TDD, FS isolation for testability, and 100% coverage.

## Recent Changes and Impacts

- Updated plan to use Vitest for testing and structured architecture for mock-free FS testing.
- No code implemented yet; plans based on brief.

## Next Steps and Open Questions

- Begin TDD implementation phase-by-phase (utils -> config -> globLogic -> adapters -> filesystem -> cli).
- Open: Confirm if Vitest v4.0 beta should be used over stable v3.2.4; user preference on exact Node.js patch version post-July 15 security release.
- Proceed to coding after Memory Bank verification.
