# Context: sync-rules

## Current Work Focus and Priorities

- Phase 1 (Utils Module) completed with 100% test coverage
- TDD approach established: write tests first, then implement minimal code
- Foundation laid with security-focused path validation and type-safe FSAction
- Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Config module with Zod validation

## Recent Changes and Impacts

- Implemented utils.ts with three core functions:
  - normalizePath: Secure path validation preventing traversal attacks
  - isValidMdFile: Validates .md files under 1MB
  - logMessage: Conditional verbose logging
- Created FSAction discriminated union type for future filesystem operations
- Achieved 100% test coverage with 20 comprehensive tests
- Established TDD workflow: tests first, minimal implementation, refactor
- Fixed vitest.config.ts by removing non-existent setupFiles reference

## Next Steps and Open Questions

- Phase 2: Config module with Zod validation
  - Define Config type and schema
  - Implement loadConfig function
  - Add validation with helpful error messages
- Continue TDD approach established in Phase 1
- Subsequent phases:
  - Phase 3: Glob logic for rule filtering
  - Phase 4: Adapter system (claude, gemini, kilocode)
  - Phase 5: Filesystem facade
  - Phase 6: Complete CLI integration
- No blockers - ready to continue implementation
