# Context: sync-rules

## Current Work Focus and Priorities

- Project has started implementation with basic CLI structure using Commander.js
- Package configured with sync-rules binary and basic hello-world command
- Project uses Node.js native TypeScript execution (>=24.0.0)
- Testing infrastructure set up with Vitest v3.2.4

## Recent Changes and Impacts

- Added Commander.js and Zod dependencies
- Updated vitest.config.ts to remove non-existent setupFiles reference
- Updated Node.js engine requirement from >=23.6.0 to >=24.0.0
- Created initial CLI structure in src/cli.ts with basic error handling
- Package version set to 2.0.0, indicating a major version from previous iteration
- Configured bin script to directly execute TypeScript file (bin/sync-rules.ts)
- Using stable Vitest v3.2.4 instead of beta

## Next Steps and Open Questions

- Implement core functionality following TDD approach:
  - Create utils module for path operations and types
  - Implement config module with Zod validation
  - Build glob logic for rule filtering
  - Create adapter system (claude, gemini, kilocode)
  - Implement filesystem facade
  - Complete CLI with actual sync functionality
- No open questions currently - proceeding with implementation based on architecture plan
