# Context: sync-rules

## Current Work Focus and Priorities

**Version 2.0.0 - Feature Complete with Comprehensive Test Coverage** ðŸŽ‰

- Project is production-ready with a comprehensive automated test suite
- All core functionality implemented, tested, and bug-free
- âœ… Fixed critical bug where rules were being globbed from project directories instead of central repository
- âœ… Achieved perfect test coverage across all modules
- âœ… Extracted PathGuard utility for better separation of concerns
- Ready for npm publishing and distribution

## Recent Changes and Impacts

The v2 implementation is complete with all modules fully tested and integrated:

- **Test Mock Consolidation (2025-07-20)**: Removed redundant normalizePath mocking from cli.test.ts and consolidated mocking approach in execution.test.ts. Updated test paths to use home directory instead of /tmp.
- **Kilocode Adapter Name Collision Fix (2025-07-20)**: Fixed critical issue where kilocode adapter was flattening directory structure using `basename()`, causing silent overwrites when rules had same filename in different directories. Now preserves full directory structure to prevent data loss. Updated tests.
- **PathGuard Utility Extraction (2025-07-20)**: Extracted path validation logic from `utils.ts` into dedicated `pathGuard.ts` class. Added comprehensive tests (32 tests). Improves code organization, reusability, and testability of security-critical path validation logic
- **Test Suite Expansion (2025-07-20)**: All test files pass. Broad unit and integration coverage ensures robustness and maintainability
- **Reporting Module Extraction (2025-07-20)**: Extracted ~54 lines of console.log blocks from CLI into dedicated `reporting.ts` module with `printProjectReport` function. Added comprehensive unit tests. Improves separation of concerns and testability
- **Path Normalization Centralization (2025-07-20)**: Refactored to normalize all paths once in `executeActions` rather than in adapters and helper functions. Added `normalizeActionPaths` helper. Improves performance and ensures security checks happen in one place
- **Critical Bug Fix (2025-07-20)**: Fixed issue where rules were incorrectly globbed from project paths instead of central repository. Added `CENTRAL_REPO_PATH` and `CENTRAL_RULES_PATH` constants and updated CLI to correctly read from `~/Developer/agent-rules/rules/`
- **Fail-Fast Refactoring (2025-07-20)**: Removed --fail-fast flag and made fail-fast behavior the default. The tool now always stops execution on first error, simplifying the codebase by ~20 lines
- **CLI**: Full command-line interface with flags for config path, dry-run, and verbose output. Now uses cleaner reporting module
- **Execution**: Sequential execution with smart action grouping, dependency checking, and prioritization (mkdir â†’ copy â†’ write)
- **Adapters**: Four working adapters (claude, cline, gemini, kilocode) with registry pattern for extensibility. Kilocode now preserves directory structure to avoid name collisions
- **Configuration**: Zod-validated JSON config with built-in path security and validation
- **Filesystem**: Native Node.js glob support with efficient rule filtering and content reading
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite across modules

## Next Steps and Open Questions

**Ready for Release:**

- Publish to npm registry
- Create GitHub releases
- Write usage documentation with examples
- Create demo video or GIF

**Potential Future Enhancements:**

- Additional adapters as new AI tools emerge
- Config file watcher for auto-sync mode
- Progress indicators for large batch operations
- Web-based configuration generator

**Open Questions:**

- Should central repository path (`~/Developer/agent-rules`) be configurable via environment variable?
- Would a --init command to bootstrap config file be helpful?
- Should there be a --validate-config mode to check configuration without syncing?
